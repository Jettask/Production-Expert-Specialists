											<h3>Experience</h3>
											  <p>We recruite from multiple industries to encourage cross-pollination of solutions and technologies. Candidates are screened for the qualities that make a great design engineer and for the interpersonal skills that make a great team member. Each new team member adds new experiences and skills to an ever-building repository of technical solutions. Years of working together have forged this group into a highly-effective execution team that knows how to get technical hardware and software to market.</p>

												<h3>Going Places</h3>
												<p>PES services encompass the entire product development lifecycle, from inception to pre-production manufacturing. Our focus on product development is evident in our singular combination of top design-engineering talent, structured development processes, and extensive onsite prototyping and testing. Every aspect of our business is a reflection of our ongoing efforts to establish the most effective contract product development engineering services available anywhere.</p>

												<h3>Innovation</h3>
												<p>The process of creating value through the application of  solutions to meaningful problems (1). Innovation is not always called for. If product requirements can be met by integrating existing solutions then they should be. Innovation is required when product requirements or new technologies drive the need for  solutions. Since novelty and utility are two of the requirements for patentability, then patents are a good measure of a team’s ability to innovate. Our engineers are inventors on hundreds of patents across a broad range of industries and technologies. We have earned a reputation in the industry for our consistent ability to develop solutions to complex technical and design problems.</p>

												<h3>Performance</h3>
												<p>is the ability to achieve results despite the challenges that are typical of real-world product development projects. It means empowering our staff to make constant progress towards project goals by optimizing their environment for problem solving. For this purpose, we maintain CNC machining, fabrication, 3D printing, product testing, and controlled assembly facilities. We observe modern best practices for software development, and we have developed proprietary software tools to automate workflows for both software and hardware development. Our product development process, based on a systems-engineering approach and systematic risk reduction, keeps projects on track and maximizes the time available for refining designs.</p>
